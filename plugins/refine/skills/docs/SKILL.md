description: "Hours-long (3-12h) multi-agent documentation-architecture optimization — verifies every claim in every non-executable text (markdown, spec systems, comments) against the code, cross-examines discrepancies into consensus, then applies only the highest-ROI fixes. Code is never modified — defects are reported, not fixed. Not for touching up a single file."
